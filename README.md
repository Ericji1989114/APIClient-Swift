# ðŸš€ APIClient (Swift)


### Network Layer

* **Network Architecture**

* **APIProtocol** (Get the idea from Moya)

	* Response Type: Because we always use object to render the view in app rathan than directly using json data/Dictionary. I created it as an associated type for an API. It will ensure that one API must has its own corresponding object.

	ðŸŒŸIn app side. Each API must conform to this prototol. and then can use **APISession** to finish the network communication.
	
* **APISession**

	* Wrap **URLSession** class to implement network communication.
	* Only accepting api instance which conform to **APIProtocol**


### Advantage

* One API should be written in one swift file. It is more convenient to maintain and read.
* One API must hold a `Response Type`. It's easier to made other developers to know the result type and use. 
* `APIProtocol` has defined all things which will be used when send urlrequest finally. 

### What can be improved

* `CustomDebugStringConvertible` which can print all information in one api. It is really helpful in debug. but how to make it be in common.
